## Features





### Tx/Rx Logic: Handles serial data transmission and reception with protocol bit management.



### Tx/Rx FIFOs (TB and RB): Buffers data for efficient handling of transmission and reception.



### Baud Generator: Supports configurable baud rates with oversampling and divisor latch.



### Registers: Includes FCR, LCR, LSR, THR, and RBR for control, status, and data handling.



### Interrupt and Modem Control: Ensures error handling and flow control for RS-232 communication.



### Testbenches: Includes Tx and Rx testbenches for design validation.
